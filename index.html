        <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <p>
          Starting with the release of God of War in 2005 on PlayStation 2,
          Santa Monica Studio has created seven games across multiple platforms
          up to the most recent release in 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now comes the sequel to the critically acclaimed God of War (2018),
          God of War Ragnarök.
        </p>
        <p>
          Join Kratos and Atreus on a mythic journey for answers before Ragnarök
          arrives. Together, father and son must put everything on the line as
          they journey to each of the Nine Realms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Armed with his trusty weapons of war – including the Leviathan Axe and
          the Blades of Chaos – Kratos’ deadly skills will be tested like never
          before as he fights to protect his family. A host of new abilities for
          him and Atreus also await, leaving room for fluid, expressive and
          customizable combat in this epic and unflinching tale.
        </p>

            <h3>Prehistory point</h3>

            <p>
              While real Norse lore and mythology was extensively researched by
              our team and is often heavily drawn from, this is our unique twist
              on the Pre-Viking, Pre-Migration Era of Norse Mythology.
            </p>

            <p class="quote-text-2">
              "In the Viking era, they always talked about, 'The gods have
              abandoned us.' Thor and Loki and Odin all walked the Earth at one
              point, but they're not around anymore. [The vikings] fight for
              them, but they're not there. This idea that we're at is saying,
              we're at a prehistory point, where gods did walk the Earth, when
              monsters were real before they became extinct."

          "On our journey we will be attacked by all manner of creature. To be effective in combat, a warrior must not feel for his enemy. Close your heart to the desperation, close your heart to their suffering. The road ahead is long and unforgiving, no place for a boy, you must be a warrior".

            <h3>Scoring God of War </h3>
            <p class="quote-text">
             "My work on God of War began nearly two years ago. One rainy November afternoon, I was called into Santa Monica Studio to meet with acclaimed music producers Pete Scaturro and Keith Leary (with whom I had collaborated closely on Sony’s SOCOM 4: US Navy Seals), to discuss a secret project. 
            </p>

            <p class="quote-text-2">
              Our conversation revolved around folk music, mythology, Nordic ethnic instruments, vocal writing, and classical thematic development. "Wait a minute." I asked. "Is this... a new God of War?!" Their facial expressions told me everything I needed to know. And with that, I realized I was tumbling headfirst into a daunting and challenging dream project."
